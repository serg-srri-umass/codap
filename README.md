The CODAP (Common Online Data Analysis Platform) software was developed through the Data Games project,
a collaboration between the Scientific Reasoning Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
and KCP Technologies, a McGraw-Hill Education Company, in San Francisco, CA.

[Data Games](http://play.ccssgames.com/) is a set of games and supporting materials that engage students
in developing mathematics and data analysis skills. The Data Games software was developed through a grant
from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under:

* KCP Technologies Award ID: 0918735
* UMass Amherst Award ID: 0918653

Grant period: September 1, 2009 through August 31, 2012  
Title: Data Games: Tools and Materials for Learning Data Modeling

The data analysis within Data Games is based in part on
[Fathom® Dynamic Data](http://www.keycurriculum.com/products/fathom) software and
[Tinkerplots® Dynamic Data Exploration](http://www.keycurriculum.com/products/tinkerplots) software,
which feature more data analysis functionality than is currently provided in Data Games.
For more information about these widely used and highly acclaimed software products,

We plan to further develop the Data Games client-side software through a new NSF-funded grant called CODAP (Common Online Data Analysis Platform), beginning in 2014. The CODAP Award ID # is: 1316728.

We encourage collaboration and feedback, and in the future aim to facilitate an active thriving community in using and contributing to this educational data analysis software.
